# About me
## Interests
* I enjoy 3d printing. Recently bought a beginner 3d printer and have been printing useful objects around the house.
* I am a big football fan. Originally from Wisconsin so, Go Pack Go!
* I enjoy spending time with my wife like going on walks, hiking trails and mountains, and going to public events with her.
## Websites I recommend
* [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en) - This is where I find most, if not all my prints. It has mostly anything you can want as other people who use it can upload their own projects for others to print.
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) - Here I can find ideas on what to print or to watch my football team beat other teams. Having started 3d printing, watching many people print what they need allows me to see if it is useful to me before I print it.
